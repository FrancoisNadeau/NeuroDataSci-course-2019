MEG = direct measurment ==> electrophysiological responses (unlike fMRI)

Hans Berger = first non-invasive

today = up to 256 (maybe more) electrodes

rejecting some artifacts like heartbeat eye mvt (saccades etc) skin potentials is easy

induced potential : time-frequency map (no negative values), slight jitter cuz not phase-locked to button pressing (i.e)
evoked potential : evoked by action/stimulation

source reconst: direct = sources 2 distrib (sphere/realistic models)
		inverse = distrib 2 source (dipole localization (dipole-fit), distributed sources) 
				- estimating amplitude and orientation of sources (dipoles)

connectivit analyses: time and frequency and directional measures (ie Granger causalitu, partial directed coherence etc) domain correlation
compute all of these for each frequency band to find correlations and cool stuff

use python tools now, matlab era is over

human connectome datasets (95 cool MEG datasets)
